## Problem Statement
Due to the nature of Interior Designs being a school of art, it is very often difficult to classify clearly an image to a unique style, at least for the untrained eye. <br/>
Hence people often come across nice designs that they like but yet do not know what style it belongs to. <br/>
Therefore I would like to attempt to develop an engine through convolutional neural network that can help us classify these images sufficiently well. <br/>
Due to the overlapping nature of styles, multiple objects in image and objects within an image that might also cross styles, this would definitely prove to be a challenge.
The goal here is to try to outperform a baseline model of 1/(no. of class) accuracy score.
